##DESCRIPTION: This notebook performs a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task to classify customer reviews as positive or negative using machine learning.

✅ Key Steps:
Importing Libraries: Uses libraries like pandas, sklearn, seaborn, and matplotlib.

Dataset Loading: Loads customer reviews from a CSV file and selects relevant columns (Review_text, Own_Rating).

Data Cleaning: Removes missing values and filters out neutral reviews to focus on binary classification (positive vs. negative).

Text Vectorization: Applies TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical features.

Model Training: Uses Logistic Regression for classification.

Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report.
